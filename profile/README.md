# StunBy: Indonesian Baby Growth Tracking App ðŸ‘¶

## About
Our application, StunBy: Indonesian Baby Growth Tracking App, aims to holistically address the pressing issue of stunting in Indonesia, which affects 21.5% of children under five. By leveraging cutting-edge technology, StunBy bridges the gaps in traditional growth monitoring systems reliant on infrequent Posyandu visits and manual recording. The app integrates Machine Learning (ML) for precise body measurement detection, growth forecasting, and stunting detection, while delivering Cloud Computing-powered real-time data processing and scalable infrastructure. Additionally, Mobile Development ensures a user-friendly interface that enables parents to monitor their childrenâ€™s growth daily, access automated nutritional recommendations, and learn through tailored educational resources. By providing immediate analysis, personalized insights, and actionable content, our app not only empowers parents with knowledge but also strengthens early detection and intervention mechanisms, fostering healthier development trajectories for children in Indonesia.
